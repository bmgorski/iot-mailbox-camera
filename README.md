# iot-mailbox-camera

This project comes in two parts the first is a particle.io board that is contected to a camera and a flex sensor. When either the flex sensor is triggered or the the web portal take picture button used it sends a picture over wifi to the second portion of project.

The sencond part of the project is a reudemenarty web app with 0 security that allows picutures to be posted to it from the particle.io device or really an other device at this point. It save the time and the sensor value of the post for display.

I think this has both potental as a remote monitoring for a mailbox but it could also be generalized for other locations where a running wires to devices might be impossible but you want to take pictures and upload them over wifi.
